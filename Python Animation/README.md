## File descriptions

**audio-control real-time canny edge detection.py**: This script combines audio and video processing in real-time and applied Canny edge detection on it. It displays both a mirrored effect and the original image with random color edges for a dynamic visual experience.


**game of life (click).py**: This script implements a visual simulation of Conway's Game of Life. The simulation unfolds on a grid of cells, with rules dictating the evolution of cell states over generations. Users can interactively toggle the simulation, set individual cell states, and observe the dynamic progression.
